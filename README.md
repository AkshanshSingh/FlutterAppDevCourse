# FlutterAppDev Winter Mentorship
This repository will contain all the study material like videos and blogs for you to read over the period of 4 weeks. Few assumptions for your consideration
1. You are free for next 4 weeks and ready to dedicate your precious time to this.
2. You have prior knowledge in some other language.

Some things to note:
1. For any doubts, you can contact me on whatsapp in the group.
2. I encourage searching on google your doubts before asking to me as it will inculcate a strong habit of solving your problems on your own using google.
3. Each week you will be provided with a task to complete which is to be completed in the same week. You will be submitting the code and screen recording of the task you have completed so that I can validate the completion of the task.

For any issues with the GirlScript Winter Mentorship Programme please contact Arpith or Akshatha.
